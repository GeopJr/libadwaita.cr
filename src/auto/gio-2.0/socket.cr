  # A #GSocket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
  # direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
  # It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
  #
  # #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
  # network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
  # use it directly, but rather through classes like #GSocketClient,
  # #GSocketService and #GSocketConnection. However there may be cases where
  # direct use of #GSocket is useful.
  #
  # #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually constructed
  # by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check the
  # results before using the object. This is done automatically in
  # g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
  # %NULL.
  #
  # Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
  # in blocking mode all operations (which donâ€™t take an explicit blocking
  # parameter) block until the requested operation
  # is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
  # would block return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error.
  # To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_socket_condition_check(),
  # or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
  # attach it to a #GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
  # Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
  # blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
  #
  # When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
  # handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
  # function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
  # of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
  # reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
  # until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
  #
  # #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
  # For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
  # either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
  # address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
  # specified or received in each I/O operation.
  #
  # All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
  #
  # Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
  # ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
  # command-line utility that uses #GSocket, you may need to take into
  # account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
  # if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
  #
  # Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
  # a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
  # locking.

    # Send multiple data messages from @socket in one go.  This is the most
    # complicated and fully-featured version of this call. For easier use, see
    # g_socket_send(), g_socket_send_to(), and g_socket_send_message().
    #
    # @messages must point to an array of #GOutputMessage structs and
    # @num_messages must be the length of this array. Each #GOutputMessage
    # contains an address to send the data to, and a pointer to an array of
    # #GOutputVector structs to describe the buffers that the data to be sent
    # for each message will be gathered from. Using multiple #GOutputVectors is
    # more memory-efficient than manually copying data from multiple sources
    # into a single buffer, and more network-efficient than making multiple
    # calls to g_socket_send(). Sending multiple messages in one go avoids the
    # overhead of making a lot of syscalls in scenarios where a lot of data
    # packets need to be sent (e.g. high-bandwidth video streaming over RTP/UDP),
    # or where the same data needs to be sent to multiple recipients.
    #
    # @flags modify how the message is sent. The commonly available arguments
    # for this are available in the #GSocketMsgFlags enum, but the
    # values there are the same as the system values, and the flags
    # are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too.
    #
    # If the socket is in blocking mode the call will block until there is
    # space for all the data in the socket queue. If there is no space available
    # and the socket is in non-blocking mode a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error
    # will be returned if no data was written at all, otherwise the number of
    # messages sent will be returned. To be notified when space is available,
    # wait for the %G_IO_OUT condition. Note though that you may still receive
    # %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from g_socket_send() even if you were previously
    # notified of a %G_IO_OUT condition. (On Windows in particular, this is
    # very common due to the way the underlying APIs work.)
