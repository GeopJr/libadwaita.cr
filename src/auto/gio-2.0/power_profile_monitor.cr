module Gio
  # #GPowerProfileMonitor makes it possible for applications as well as OS components
  # to monitor system power profiles and act upon them. It currently only exports
  # whether the system is in “Power Saver” mode (known as “Low Power” mode on
  # some systems).
  #
  # When in “Low Power” mode, it is recommended that applications:
  # - disabling automatic downloads
  # - reduce the rate of refresh from online sources such as calendar or
  #   email synchronisation
  # - if the application has expensive visual effects, reduce them
  #
  # It is also likely that OS components providing services to applications will
  # lower their own background activity, for the sake of the system.
  #
  # There are a variety of tools that exist for power consumption analysis, but those
  # usually depend on the OS and hardware used. On Linux, one could use `upower` to
  # monitor the battery discharge rate, `powertop` to check on the background activity
  # or activity at all), `sysprof` to inspect CPU usage, and `intel_gpu_time` to
  # profile GPU usage.
  #
  # Don't forget to disconnect the #GPowerProfileMonitor::notify::power-saver-enabled
  # signal, and unref the #GPowerProfileMonitor itself when exiting.
