module Gio
  # #GListModel is an interface that represents a mutable list of
  # #GObjects. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets in
  # user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
  # convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
  # updates.
  #
  # Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
  # mechanism (normally the #GObject::notify signal).  Taken together
  # with the #GListModel::items-changed signal, this provides for a list
  # that can change its membership, and in which the members can change
  # their individual properties.
  #
  # A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
  # points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
  # signal strength.
  #
  # It is important to note that the #GListModel itself does not report
  # changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
  # membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
  # then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
  # interested in.
  #
  # All items in a #GListModel are of (or derived from) the same type.
  # g_list_model_get_item_type() returns that type.  The type may be an
  # interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
  #
  # The semantics are close to that of an array:
  # g_list_model_get_n_items() returns the number of items in the list and
  # g_list_model_get_item() returns an item at a (0-based) position. In
  # order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
  # you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
  # g_list_model_get_item() until it returns %NULL.
  #
  # An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
  # return the same object for a given position until all references to
  # it are gone.
  #
  # On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
  # objects that are currently "user visible", in order to facilitate the
  # maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
  # reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
  #
  # This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
  # thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
  # implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
  # the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
  # in effect at the time that the model was created.
