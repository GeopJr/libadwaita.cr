module Gio
  # Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
  # really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
  # #GtkBuilder .ui files, splashscreen images, GMenu markup XML, CSS files,
  # icons, etc. These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or
  # manually included as literal strings in the code.
  #
  # The #GResource API and the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
  # provide a convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties. You
  # maintain the files as normal files, so its easy to edit them, but during the build the files
  # are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the executable. This means that loading
  # the resource files are efficient (as they are already in memory, shared with other instances) and
  # simple (no need to check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
  # also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
  #
  # Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included in the resource bundle
  # in a compressed form, but will be automatically uncompressed when the resource is used. This
  # is very useful e.g. for larger text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
  #
  # Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
  # `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
  # The only options currently supported are:
  #
  # `xml-stripblanks` which will use the xmllint command
  # to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
  # the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
  # the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
  # the preprocessing step is skipped.
  #
  # `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
  # `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the #GdkPixdata format,
  # which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside the
  # resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
  # `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
  # `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
  # `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will abort.
  # `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as #GResource
  # supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead of using it,
  # embed a PNG or SVG file in your #GResource.
  #
  # `json-stripblanks` which will use the `json-glib-format` command to strip
  # ignorable whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the
  # `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
  # `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`;
  # otherwise the preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version
  # 1.6 of `json-glib-format` is required.
  #
  # Resource files will be exported in the GResource namespace using the
  # combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
  # The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
  # different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
  # include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
  # directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
  #
  # Resource bundles are created by the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
  # which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that the XML references. These
  # are combined into a binary resource bundle.
  #
  # An example resource description:
  # |[
  # <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  # <gresources>
  #   <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
  #     <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
  #     <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
  #     <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
  #     <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
  #   </gresource>
  # </gresources>
  # ]|
  #
  # This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
  # |[
  # /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
  # /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
  # /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
  # /org/gtk/Example/example.css
  # ]|
  #
  # Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use Java-style
  # path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
  #
  # You can then use [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] to compile the XML to a
  # binary bundle that you can load with g_resource_load(). However, its more common to use the --generate-source and
  # --generate-header arguments to create a source file and header to link directly into your application.
  # This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
  # `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
  # to [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources]. `get_resource()` returns
  # the generated #GResource object. The register and unregister functions
  # register the resource so its files can be accessed using
  # g_resources_lookup_data().
  #
  # Once a #GResource has been created and registered all the data in it can be accessed globally in the process by
  # using API calls like g_resources_open_stream() to stream the data or g_resources_lookup_data() to get a direct pointer
  # to the data. You can also use URIs like "resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png" with #GFile to access
  # the resource data.
  #
  # Some higher-level APIs, such as #GtkApplication, will automatically load
  # resources from certain well-known paths in the resource namespace as a
  # convenience. See the documentation for those APIs for details.
  #
  # There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the compiler support for constructor
  # and destructor functions (where available) to automatically create and register the #GResource on startup
  # or library load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to register/unregister the resource are created
  # instead. This requires an explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all platforms,
  # even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported. (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
  #
  # Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a library, so if you are unloading libraries
  # during runtime you need to be very careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes away
  # when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally a problem, since most resource accesses
  # are for your own resources, and resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
  #
  # When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is often useful to be able to
  # replace resources in the program or library, without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing
  # purposes. Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment variable to selectively overlay
  # resources with replacements from the filesystem.  It is a %G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR-separated list of substitutions to perform
  # during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid process.
  #
  # A substitution has the form
  #
  # |[
  #    /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
  # ]|
  #
  # The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay applies.  The part after is a
  # filesystem path which contains files and subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
  # equivalent names.
  #
  # In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the resource path
  # `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then GResource would check the filesystem path
  # `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was found there, it would be used instead.  This is an
  # overlay, not an outright replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the built-in
  # version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently supported.
  #
  # Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash before the '='.  The path after
  # the slash should ideally be absolute, but this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the
  # location of a single resource with an individual file.
