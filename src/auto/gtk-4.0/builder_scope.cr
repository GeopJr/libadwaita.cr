  # `GtkBuilderScope` is an interface to provide language binding support
  # to `GtkBuilder`.
  #
  # The goal of `GtkBuilderScope` is to look up programming-language-specific
  # values for strings that are given in a `GtkBuilder` UI file.
  #
  # The primary intended audience is bindings that want to provide deeper
  # integration of `GtkBuilder` into the language.
  #
  # A `GtkBuilderScope` instance may be used with multiple `GtkBuilder` objects,
  # even at once.
  #
  # By default, GTK will use its own implementation of `GtkBuilderScope`
  # for the C language which can be created via [ctor@Gtk.BuilderCScope.new].
